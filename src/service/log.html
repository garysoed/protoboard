  /**
   * A service to log events and happenings in a game. Use this service to collect statistics about
   * a game session.
   *
   * By default, the service records all triggers to every
   * {{#crossLink "ability.Ability"}}abilities{{/crossLink}} loaded. The format of a log entry is:
   * `<timestamp>: <category> - <value>`. For abilities, `category` is the ability's name, and the
   * `value` is the value of `pb-id` of the element the ability acts on.
   *
   * For every Protoboard component, region, and grid, you can customize the prefix of the id by
   * specifying the `pb-id` attribute. When the element is activated, Protoboard will append a
   * number to the attribute to make sure that they are unique. For instance:
   * ```html
   * <pb-c-card pb-id="attack"></pb-c-card>
   * ```
   * will have its `pb-id` set to `attack-0`. So when the card is `flip`ped, this service will log
   * `3/28/2015, 6:01:48 PM: flip - attack-0`.
   *
   * For entries not handled by Abilities, you can also add log entries manually. Use the
   * {{#crossLink "service.Log/log:method"}}{{/crossLink}} method. For instance:
   * ```javascript
   * DI.run(['service.=', function(Log) {
   *   Log.log('player-count', 2);
   * }]);
   * ```
   * will generate entry: `3/28/2015, 6:01:48 PM: player-count - 2`.
   *
   * You can also customize the string output using the
   * {{#crossLink "service.Log/addProcessor:method"}}{{/crossLink}} method. For example:
   * ```javascript
   * DI.run(['service.=', function(Log) {
   *   Log
   *       .addProcessor(function(timestamp, category, value) {
   *         if (category !== 'player-count') {
   *           return timestamp.toLocaleString() + ': ' + category + ' on ' + value;
   *         } else {
   *           return null;
   *         }
   *       })
   *      .addProcessor(Log.defaultProcessor)
   *      .log('player-count', 2)
   *      .log('rng-seed', 1234);
   * }]);
   * ```
   * A processor is a function that takes 3 arguments:
   * 1. `timestamp` of type {{#crossLink "Date"}}{{/crossLink}}.
   * 2. `category` {{#crossLink "String"}}{{/crossLink}}.
   * 3. `value`
   * You can specify more than one processors. The processors will be called in the other that they
   * are added to the service. The value that will be used for the log entry is the value returned
   * by the first processor that returns a non empty string.
   *
   * So the example above will generate:
   * ```
   * 3/28/2015, 6:21:47 PM: player-count on 2
   * 3/28/2015, 6:21:53 PM: rng-seed - 1234
   * ```
   * The custom processor was used to generate the entry for `player-count`, while the default
   * processor was used to generate the one for `rng-seed`.
   *
   * You can retrieve the entries using {{#crossLink "service.Log/blob:property"}}{{/crossLink}} as
   * a blob, or {{#crossLink "service.Log/entries:property"}}{{/crossLink}} as a string.
   *
