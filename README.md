## Release notes
### 0.3.0
New
- `pb-state` element to keep the runtime state of the game.
- Added counters for regions. Now you can see how many cards are in a deck, etc.
- `pb-cube-tower`
- ACL Service used to control.

Breaking changes
- Removed `pb-` prefix from default ability names.
- Changed `pb-card` faces to use `pb-front` and `pb-back` attributes instead of `pb-card` and
`pb-back` classes.
- Changed grids to use `row` and `col` attributes for the row and column counts, instead of `pb-row`
 and `pb-col`.

Improvements
- Some code cleanup.
- Config service now allows you to set the trigger of all abilities with the same name.
- Abilities can now be triggered through JavaScript, using the
[Abilities](http://garysoed.github.io/protoboard/classes/ability.Abilities.html) class.
