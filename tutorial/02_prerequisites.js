/**
 * 1. Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).
 * 1. Unpack the binary in the directory, or install using [bower](http://bower.io/):
 *
 *    ```
 *    bower install --save protoboard
 *    ```
 *
 * 1. Protoboard relies on
 *    [HTML Import](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/). So you will need
 *    an HTTP server serving static files. A simple one you can use is
 *    [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server):
 *    `npm install http-server`.
 * 1. Run `http-server` from the root directory of the project, and navigate to the file you want to
 *    open. A good one to start is `ex/all/index.html`.
